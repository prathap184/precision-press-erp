/**
 * Pull the latest exchange rates from the configured provider and upsert them
 * for every organization, quoted against each org's base (default) currency.
 *
 * - Each org base is triangulated out of a single feed, so base-currency
 *   support never depends on the provider honouring the base param (works on
 *   free plans too). See ./triangulate.
 * - Feeds are cached per fetch and reused for any base they can reach, so we
 *   make as few external calls as possible (matters for rate-limited free tiers).
 * - Stores rates as `source: "api"`, and never overwrites a `manual` rate for
 *   the same day (manual override wins).
 *
 * Returns counts for observability. Designed to run daily via Trigger.dev.
